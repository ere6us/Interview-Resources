+ [x] [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
    ```
    Explaination
    N1: distance between head and entry
    N2: distance between entry and meeting point
    Distance travelled by slow: N1 + N2
    Distance travelled by fast: N1 + N2 + x + N2
    x : remaining length of the cycle
    Since fast pointer traveled twice as slow pointer,
    2(N1 + N2) = N1 + N2 + x + N2
    => x = N1
    So we need to travel N1 steps from current meeting point
    to get to the entry point.

```
The lo we returned is guaranteed to be an element in the matrix is because:
Let us assume element m is the kth smallest number in the matrix, and x is the number of element m in the matrix. When we are about to reach convergence, if mid=m-1, its count value (the number of elements which are <= mid) would be k-x, so we would set lo as (m-1)+1=m, in this case the hi will finally reach lo; and if mid=m+1, its count value would be k+x-1, so we would set hi as m+1, in this case the lo will finally reach m.
To sum up, because the number lo found by binary search find is exactly the element which has k number of elements in the matrix that are <= lo, The equal sign guarantees there exists and only exists one number in range satisfying this condition. So lo must be the only element satisfying this element in the matrix.
